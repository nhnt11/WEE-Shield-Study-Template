# WebExtension Experiment Shield Study Template
This is a spin-off of the Firefox Monitor Shield Study addon (https://github.com/mozilla/blurts-addon).

The idea is to capture a minimal template for studies that require the control and versatility of a bootstrap addon,
providing the basic shield study wrapper code, packaged l10n, and a simple mechanism to pass telemetry from the privileged context
to the Shield study WebExtension API.

The template also provides a basic directory structure and build setup (including eslint).

## Requirements
* Use an unbranded build for testing - see `https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Extension_Signing#Unbranded_Builds`

## Setup
1. Fork the repo
2. Change add-on specific metadata in `package.json` and `src/manifest.json`
3. `$npm install`

## Running
1. `$export FIREFOX_BINARY=/path/to/unbranded/firefox/binary`
3. `$npm start`

## Building
`$npm run build`

## Basic use
- Just look at Experiment.jsm. You might not need to mess with anything else. :)
- Strings are attempted to be loaded from `locales/${AppConstants.INSTALL_LOCALE}/strings.properties`, falling back to `locales/en-US/strings.properties`. Add strings to `strings.properties` files in `locales/foo-BAR/` and use `getString()` and `getFormattedString()` to work with strings (see code in `Experiment.jsm`).
- If you are confused by the scoping mechanisms and Globals.jsm, read on.

## Under the hood
- This template implements a WebExtension Experiment API called `firefoxhooks`, accessible via `browser.firefoxhooks`.
- The API provides a simple event listener mechanism that allows passing objects from the privileged context to the extension context. Search for `gEventListener` in `background.js`. The event mechanism is used in the template for Telemetry, but can probably easily be repurposed.
- `Globals.jsm` is the entry point of the shared scope into which Firefox code is to be plugged in. `Globals.jsm` is loaded immediately upon addon installation from the `firefoxhooks API` implementation (`api.js`).
- `ChromeUtils.import` doesn't seem to work for resources that are packaged in an archive, so `Services.scriptloader.loadSubScript` is substituded everywhere. The imports are done in a way that `Globals.jsm`, `FirefoxHooks.jsm`, and `Experiment.jsm` all share the same global scope.
- `FirefoxHooks.jsm` implements the WEE API, and tells `Experiment.jsm` when to `init()` and `cleanup()`.
- Shield studies are not supposed to be re-installed after the add-on is disabled/uninstalled by the user. `FirefoxHooks.jsm` takes care of nuking the addon installation if this happens.
